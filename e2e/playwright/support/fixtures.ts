/**
 * One app instance per Playwright worker.
 *
 * Every spec signs in as the single owner and writes into one book, so specs
 * sharing a database have to take turns. Instead each worker starts its own
 * `dist/rekenraam` (built once in global-setup.ts) on its own port, against
 * its own SQLite file and backup directory, and `baseURL` points the worker's
 * pages at it. Workers then run side by side without seeing each other's
 * books.
 *
 * The database is keyed by project and parallel index, not by worker process:
 * a worker restarted after a failure picks up the same file, so files still
 * see one database for the whole run, as they did when the run shared one.
 * The `bootstrap` project gets a key of its own, which is what hands
 * auth.spec.ts the owner-less database it needs.
 *
 * With E2E_BASE_URL set, the external app is used as-is and nothing starts;
 * the config then holds the run to one worker, since that app has one book.
 *
 * Specs import `test` and `expect` from here, not from '@playwright/test'.
