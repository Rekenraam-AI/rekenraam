# Regenerates a frozen release seed fixture for the historical-upgrade test.
#
# The existing fixture describes the consolidated candidate baseline, not an
# installed release. TestMigrateSeededBaselineMatchesFreshSchema loads it into
# migration 0001, repeats migration admission, and asserts every durable
# figure survived.
#
# #405 rebased the unused candidate fixture under ADR 0013; no installed or
# legacy database exists. All installed-release fixtures remain frozen.
# EXISTING FIXTURES ARE FROZEN. Regenerating v01_seed.sql against a later schema
# defeats the test it feeds: the point is to migrate data written by the OLD
# app, which current code may no longer be able to produce. Use this to create
# the seed for a NEW release, into a new file.
#
# Output is not byte-reproducible: the book carries real timestamps, request
# UUIDs, and a session token hash. Two runs produce equivalent books, not
# identical files — which is another reason to freeze a fixture rather than
# regenerate it.
